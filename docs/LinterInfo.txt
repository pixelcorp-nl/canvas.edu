We use a linter for all JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue Files

You can lint the repository by running:
- make lint
- make lint-fix

If ESLint is not installed the script will complain and ask you to install it locally.
Instructions are provided

When merging with the main all linter errors and warnings should be solved
if not the merge will be blocked

You can download the ESLint extension to automatically lint
