To prevent a large project from becoming messy and opaque to its contributors 
we should have a clear style guide when it comes to applying commits.

This document may be edited over the duration of the project, but serves as a 
reference point as an agreed upon format that all commits must try to adhere to.

Let's treat this project as a portfolio piece, something implementing all the 
best practices and as something you'd be proud to show off!

Rule 1: The subject line of a commit should be in the imperative.
	It should be able to be placed at the end of the following sentence:
	"If applied, this commit will [...]"

Rule 2: The body should be separated from the subject.
	Most commits will be sizeable enough to warrant further explanation with a 
	body. This body should be separated from the subject line by a single 
	empty line.
	This can be done by using the git commit command in the following way:
	git commit -m "[subject line]" -m "[clarifying body]"

Rule 3: The body should be relevant to the subject.
	Do not mention anything in the body that is not a direct expansion on what
	has been indicated by the subject line. The body is strictly where you add 
	further details about the mentioned feature, not add new features.

Rule 4: If the above rules cannot be followed, split your commit into multiple parts.
	These rules are more than just about being a coding grammar-nazi. They're 
	an indication that the underlying code is itself intelligible and a logical,
	modular expansion to the existing project. A five person team needs this to 
	understand every facet despite only writing (ideally) 20% themselves.

Rule 5: Commit little and often.
	The perfect commit introduces only one new feature, or changes an existing 
	part in exactly one way. Try to force yourself to think in commits, rather 
	than committing as an afterthought with everything you did that day.
